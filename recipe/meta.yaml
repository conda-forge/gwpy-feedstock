  summary: A python package for gravitational-wave astrophysics
  description: |
    GWpy is a collaboration-driven Python package providing tools for
    studying data from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

    GWpy provides a user-friendly, intuitive interface to the common
    time-domain and frequency-domain data produced by the LIGO and Virgo
    observatories and their analyses, with easy-to-follow tutorials at each
    step.
